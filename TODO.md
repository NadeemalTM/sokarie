# TODO List for Fixing Layout Bugs, Adding Images, and More Products

## 1. Fix Layout Bugs
- [x] Adjust Products.css for proper flex layout and add responsiveness
- [x] Add missing CSS classes in ProductCard.css (.product-image, .hover-overlay, .star-filled, .star-empty)
- [x] Add missing add-to-cart button in ProductCard.jsx if needed

## 2. Add More Products
- [x] Expand products array in server/index.js with additional items
- [ ] Ensure image paths are correct and add placeholder images if necessary

## 3. Add Images
- [x] Create public/images/ folder
- [ ] Add product images (tshirt1.jpg, yogapants1.jpg, sportjacket1.jpg, runningshoes1.jpg, baseballcap1.jpg, sportswatch1.jpg) - Note: Images need to be added manually as binary files cannot be created via text tools
- [ ] Update image paths in product data if needed

## 4. Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test the layout on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify product grid displays correctly
- [ ] Check filters functionality
- [ ] Ensure images load properly
